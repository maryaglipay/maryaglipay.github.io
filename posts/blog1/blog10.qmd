"In its simplest form, an ITS is modelled using a regression model (such
as linear, logistic, or Poisson) that includes only three time based
covariates, whose regression coefficients estimate the pre-intervention
slope, the change in level at the intervention point, and the change in
slope from pre-intervention to post-intervention" @kontopantelis2015

$logit(Y)=B_0 + B_1 time + B_2 after + B_3time*after$

$B_1$ is interpreted as the pre-intervention slope

$B_2$ is interpreted as the jump in Y after the interruption

$B_3$ is interpreted as the post-intervention slope

##### Strengths of the interrupted time series design

1.  Compared to pre-post designs: Interrupted time series analyses can
    take into account the pattern, or slope, of the trend before and
    after the intervention and determine whether the was a real
    difference. For example, @penfold2013 uses the example of an
    intervention to prevent medication errors. See Figure 1 below. If we
    were just to use a pre-post analysis, we might erroneously make the
    conclusion that the intervention caused a change in the medication
    error rate. However, if we examine the slope, it appears that the
    trend of medication error was downward anyway, and the intervention
    did little to change that trend.

2.  Ease of interpretation. The graphs that come out of an ITS is
    generally well-understood

##### Limitations of Interrupted Time Series Design

1.  Preferably 8 or 9 measures on each side of the interruption

2.  More likely to be impacted by cyclical trends (pre and post periods
    should be matched on cycle) - this is especially key for things that
    influenza. We should try to compare NPI slopes within the same
    season

#### Comparison with D-I-D Design

D-I-D design measures the change in outcome pre and post intervention
for an exposed group and a control group, and then finds these
diffferences to see the "difference in differences" (see @warton).
