Let's talk assumptions!

#### Project 1: Single Group Interrupted time series:

(See @Warton)

1.  Pre-intervention trends are linear (can be challenging when there are only a few pre-intervention time points)
2.  Exchangeability between pre and post periods--i.e. there is nothing that changes between our population before and after the interruption.
3.  Adequate number of measures before and after the intervention
4.  No interruptions affecting the outcome occur within the study period
5.  Intervention is instantantenous.

Benefits of having a control group: the unexposed group will capture temporal changes that would affect the intervention group in the same fashion had the interruption not occurred.

#### Project 2: Parametric g-formula

See @hern√°n

1.  Exchangeability: No confounding
2.  Positivity: There should be all levels of the exposure in all confounder strata
3.  All assumptions required for regression equations in general:
    1.  Logistic Regression

        1.  Independent errors

        2.  linearity (for logistic regression, linearity in the logit for continuous variables)

        3.  Strongly influential outliers

    2.  Linear Regression

        1.  Linearity

        2.  Multivariate normality

        3.  No autocorrelation

        4.  Homoscedasticity (error term is the same across all values of the independent variables)

#### Project 3: Cox proportional hazards model 

See @kleinbaum2005

1.  Proportional hazards
2.  Linearity between log hazard and covariate
