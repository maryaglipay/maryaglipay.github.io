A question I get often when I'm doing a talk is, "what are the limitations of the data that you're using?" And it's a great question.  We should always think what our data can tell us and what it can't.

One of my first data sources is a large children's cohort study.  The strengths of this data is that it has rich, repeated measures about adherence to NPIs, about parent-reported infection, symptoms, sociodemographics, lifestyle, child health behaviours.  It samples from primary care, which is great because we know that more than 95% of children access primary care in the first few years of life. 
Selection biasesSome of the limitations it includes--well, like many other cohorts, it suffers from selection processes that make it easier for richer, more educated, whiter participants to participate in the study.  This may limit its external generalizability. Another limitation, in the some vein, is that richer, more educated families tend to remain in the study longer than those who are not.  What does that mean?  Well, if richer, whiter people are more likely to adhere to masks, and they are also less likely to get infected, and it would bias the resut away from the null. 
Measurement error:  Like other studies that use survey data, there is a certain amount of measurement error that comes along with questionnaires.  For example, families might have trouble recalling how many days their child was adherent to masks.  
Confounding.  One of the strengths of cohort studies is that they can collect really rich confounder information.  For example, TARGet Kids! has great information not only on child NPI adherence, but they also have information on parent NPI adherence, household income, maternal and paternal education.  


The next data source are population health administrative data.  This is data that is usually collected for billing and administrative purposes.  I am able to obtain detailed vaccination data 
Selection biases:  The nice thing about administrative data is that it is concerned population-based--encounters with the healthcare system, which is public in Canada, are recorded.  However, in the test negative design, we are restricted to participants who were able to access testing for their child.  For the most part, this included children of essential workers working (including physicians). However, although government restirictions were the same across Ontario, the manner in which they were implemented from hospital to hospital differed.
Measurement error: PCR testing is the gold standard for
